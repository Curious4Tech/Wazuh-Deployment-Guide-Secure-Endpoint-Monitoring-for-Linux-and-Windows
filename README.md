## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Wazuh Using the Virtual Machine (OVA)

### 1. **Download the Wazuh Virtual Appliance (OVA)**
   - Download the pre-built Wazuh OVA file for version 4.9.2 from [Wazuh's official site](https://packages.wazuh.com/4.x/vm/wazuh-4.9.2.ova).
   - The OVA includes the following components:
     - **Amazon Linux 2**
     - **Wazuh manager 4.9.2**
     - **Wazuh indexer 4.9.2**
     - **Filebeat-OSS 7.10.2**
     - **Wazuh dashboard 4.9.2**

### 2. **Check System Requirements**
   - Ensure your host system is 64-bit.
   - Enable **hardware virtualization** in the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) of your host.
   - Install a virtualization platform like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** or **Hyper-V**.

   **Default Hardware Configuration for Wazuh VM:**
   - **CPU:** 4 cores
   - **RAM:** 8 GB
   - **Storage:** 50 GB

   *Note:* Modify the configuration based on your needs.

### 3. **Import the OVA File**

   - Import the downloaded OVA file:
     - In VMware, go to `File > Open...`

  - Your VM has been successfully imported. You can now add more RAM (e,g: from 8Gb to 10Gb), Storage ( From 50 Gb to 80Gb) and CPUs (4 to 8) if you want or have more resources. Also choose the correct network  adapter (e.g, from bridge to NAT) for the sake of this demo. And then click on `Power on this virtual machne`

### 4. **Start the Virtual Machine**
   - Start the VM from your virtualization platform.
   - Login credentials for the VM:
     - **Username:** `wazuh-user`
     - **Password:** `wazuh`
   - To escalate to root privileges, run:
     ```bash
     sudo -i
     ```

### 6. **Find the VM's IP Address**
   - Inside the VM, run the following command to get the IP address:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```

### 7. **Access the Wazuh Dashboard**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to:
     ```text
     https://<wazuh_server_ip>
     ```
   - Replace `<wazuh_server_ip>` with the IP address obtained in the previous step.
   - Dashboard login credentials:
     - **Username:** `admin`
     - **Password:** `admin`

### Additional Notes
- Adjust hardware settings in the virtualization platform if needed to handle more endpoints or data.
- SSH login as `root` is disabled by default. Use the `wazuh-user` account with `sudo` privileges for administrative tasks.
