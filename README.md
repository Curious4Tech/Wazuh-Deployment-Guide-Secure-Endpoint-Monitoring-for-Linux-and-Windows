## Step-by-Step Guide: Installing Wazuh Using the Virtual Machine (OVA)

### 1. **Download the Wazuh Virtual Appliance (OVA)**

     - **Wazuh dashboard 4.9.2**

### 2. **Check System Requirements**
   - Ensure your host system is 64-bit.
   - Enable **hardware virtualization** in the firmware (BIOS/UEFI) of your host.
   - Install a virtualization platform like **VirtualBox** or **VMware** or **Hyper-V**.

   **Default Hardware Configuration for Wazuh VM:**
